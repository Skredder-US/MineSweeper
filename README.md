# MineSweeper
Text-based Minesweeper made quickly for me to play because my computer had no Minesweeper!

I wanted to play Minesweeper one day but my computer didn't have it! I quickly made my own and played a few rounds with simple settings (still fun!) It's text-based, robust (in case of typo,) and quickly made for me. SIZE and NUM_MINES are code editable.
